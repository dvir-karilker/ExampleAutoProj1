Description:
This Automation Project's purpose is to perform an end-to-end automation test on the "Publish Ad" (פרסום מודעה) Page's functionality.
The Test will be divided to "mini-tests", using a created Class' Methods, to adjust Selenium's methods to be reused and for different scenarios, and performed
using the Pytest Framework.

The Test will be performed in the following steps:
1. Navigating to the System.
2. Logging in to the System using the credentials provided to me.
3. Creating a New Listing using ALL details (only Valid/Positive scenario is tested).
4. Checking that the New Listing is created by Validating its Creation and Details in a few places.
